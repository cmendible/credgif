# credgif

Create an animated gif using your [Credly](https://credly.com) badges.

## Usage

To generate a gif, you need to have a [Credly](https://credly.com) account and have your badges public.

Run the following command:

```bash	
./credgif -u <credly username>
```

For a smaller gif, use the `-s` flag.

```bash	
./credgif -u <credly username> -s
```

For help, use the `-h` flag.

```bash
./credgif -h
```
